How to Find Application Name
=============================

  0. This may borken your GNOME, BE CAREFUL AND BACK UP FIRST!!!!
  1. You need root permission to do this.
  2. Edit `/usr/share/gnome-shell/js/ui/statusIconDispatcher.js`
  3. Move to line 48, you should see a function called `_onTrayIconAdded` which look like the following:

        _onTrayIconAdded: function(o, icon) {
            let wmClass = (icon.wm_class || 'unknown').toLowerCase();
            let role = STANDARD_TRAY_ICON_IMPLEMENTATIONS[wmClass];
            if (role)
                this.emit('status-icon-added', icon, role);
            else
                this.emit('message-icon-added', icon);
        },  

  4. Add `global.log("wmClass[] = " + wmClass);` after the line of `let role = ...`, now this function should look like the following:

        _onTrayIconAdded: function(o, icon) {
            let wmClass = (icon.wm_class || 'unknown').toLowerCase();
            let role = STANDARD_TRAY_ICON_IMPLEMENTATIONS[wmClass];
            global.log("wmClass[] = " + wmClass);
            if (role)
                this.emit('status-icon-added', icon, role);
            else
                this.emit('message-icon-added', icon);
        },  

  5. Restart GNOME 3 by pressing `Alt + F2` and `r` and hit enter.
  6. Start GNOME console by pressing `Alt + F2` and `lg` and hit enter.
  7. Switch to the `Errors` tab, now you should see message like the following:

        wmClass[] = deadbeef
        wmClass[] = pidgin

  8. The above is all tray icons you have now, choose the tray icons you want to appear on the menu (top) bar, and put their names into `notification` array.
  9. Restart GNOME, now you should see them on top bar. Goold Luck! :)
